## My process
      body
- font size = 15px
- line height = 1.5
- background-color = #f4f4f4 

      header
- I first worked on the header which is comprised of an h1 element and an unordered list items(display inline)
- The h1 element was used for branding and the ul for navigation
- The h1 element was floated left while the ul was floated right(its advised to use flexbox)
- lastly i added the hover feature to my header links(the nav)
